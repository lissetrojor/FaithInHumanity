    <p>John Lewis was an American social justice and civil rights leader. Lewis marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in protest of voting rights for African-Americans. Lewis also was one of the main leaders in putting together the March on Washinton, where MLK Jr. gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech in front of thousands. In 1987, Lewis was voted into the US House of Representatives to represent the state of Georgia, where he served until his death on July 17, 2020. Lewis will always be remembered for all he has done as a lifelong civil rights leader.  </p>

    <p>Due to COVID-19, like many other sports and major events, the NBA and WNBA season have both been changed drastically. Players for both leagues have chosen to restart their seasons within quarantined "bubbles" in Florida, but the players have also chosen to dedicate their seasons to fighting social injustice. Many players have chosen to opt of playing altogether in order to fight social injustice, but those who chose to play have chosen to use thier voices and platforms to only talk about creating social justice within America. The NBA players will put the name of those killed by police brutality on the back of their jerseys, while WNBA players have chosen to put Breonna Taylor's name on their jerseys. Both leagues have chosen to paint "Black Lives Matter" on all courts for the games. </p>

    <p>The chairman of NBC Universal, Cesar Conde, has issued a challege for the company to try and have at least 50% of their employees be poeple of color, as well as 50% of their employees be women within the next 10 years. Conde announced the initiative in early July and hopes that this challenge will create more diversity, as well as more representaiton, within newsrooms across the country. For both women and people of color, there ahs been a huge lack of oppritunites within the mainstream news media fields, and this program is aiming to change that in a major way.</p>

    <p> This year, California became the first state in the country to make discrimantion against natural hair illegal within schools and workplaces. Different natural hair types can include: afros, braids, twists, dredlocks, etc. Many black people often chose to wear their hair in these, or other styles, and have previously been told it would not be acceptable or professional enough in their workplace or school. With this law, called the CROWN Act, now passed it creates an environment for people to live freely and openly with their natural hair.  </p>

    <p> After many years of disapproval and protest the Washington Redskins have officially changed their name and logo. The team and its now former name have existed since 1932, and since the 1960s Native Americans have questions and protested its use and logo. Many Native Americans dissaproved of the name and logo, saying it was both offensive and racist, but the team refused to change them. Finally, due to the protests and many sponsors putting pressure on the team, in July 2020 the logo was removed and the team now goes by: The Washington Football Team. </p>
